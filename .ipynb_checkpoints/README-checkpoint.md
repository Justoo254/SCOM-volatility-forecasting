#project Objectives
If you have ever analyzed stock returns you would notice that periods of high volatility are usually followed by periods of high volatility, and periods of low volatility followed by more periods of low volatility(data exhibits volatility clustering).This common characteristic of financial markets can only be best addressed by time-varying models such as GARCH and ARCH, unlike traditional ARIMA models which assume constant variance.
